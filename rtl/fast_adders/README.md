# Fast Adders Implementation

Comparison of different Parallel Prefix Adder architectures aimed at reducing latency logarithmic time O(log n).

## Architectures
1. **Kogge-Stone:** Low fan-out, high wiring congestion, very fast.
2. **Brent-Kung:** Higher fan-out, lower area, slightly slower.
3. **Sklansky:** Simple structure, higher fan-out issues on large bits.
