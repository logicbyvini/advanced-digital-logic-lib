# Advanced Digital Logic Library

## Overview
This repository contains RTL implementations of advanced digital logic architectures, focusing on arithmetic optimization and high-performance computing blocks. Developed as part of the CI Brasil (CI Digital) training program.

## Key Modules
* **Fast Adders:** Parallel prefix architectures (Kogge-Stone, Brent-Kung, Sklansky) to optimize Critical Path delay.
* **Complex Arithmetic:** Wallace Tree Multiplier for efficient partial product reduction.
* **Floating Point:** FPU implementation complying with standard floating-point arithmetic.
* **DSP:** Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter design.

## Future Roadmap
* Implementation of UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) environments for each block (Planned for CI Expert phase).
* Synthesis and Timing Analysis reports.
